# The Umi

> This is the [final boss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnBLaEnFSUk) of the Full Chain series. Enjoy!

## Challenge

```
https://chal-the-umi.hitconctf.com:8000/
```

## Introduction

- You need to complete `wall-sina`, `wall-rose`, and `wall-maria` before you begin this challenge
    - **Whether you choose to finish `the-blade` before solving this challenge is optional; you can just use the tool directly**
- This is a pentest-style challenge, and there should be no additional pwnable vulnerabilities except for the ones in `wall-sina`, `wall-rose`, and `wall-maria` (and maybe 0days :) ).

## Mindmap

1. Chroot Jailbreak in Linux VM
    - **Covered in `wall-sina`**
2. Privilege Escalation in Linux VM
    - **Covered in `wall-rose`**
3. Qemu VM Escape
    - **Covered in `wall-maria`**
4. Seccomp Shell "Escape" â†’ Remote Code Execution in Docker
    - You can use the binary in **`the-blade`** to simplify such process
5. Privilege Escalation in Docker
    - Find misconfigurations in the docker environment to achieve privilege escalation. (***DON'T ATTACK THE KERNEL PLEASE***)
6. ***STOP HERE! DO NOT TRY TO ESCAPE THE DOCKER OR ATTACK THE KERNEL PLEASE!***

## Flag location

- Somewhere in `/root`
